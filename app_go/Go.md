# Web App 

## Framework 

I not used any framework cause `net/http` library enough

## Development 

- Created http server that listen on port 3000. 
- Handling request by URL "/(city)" where write name of city 

## Library 
+ colly - to web scraping 
+ net/http - to build http server
+ html/templates - to show html pages
+ log - to logging all errors 

## Best practices 
+ Used module to store libs
+ meaningful variable names 
+ Avoid nesting by handling errors
+ DRY(don't repeat yourself)
+ Code seperated by files, it's easy to navigate and expand
